# Fraud Detection Project - Executive Summary
## Final Week Progress Report

### Project Status: 75% Complete

---

## Key Achievements ✅

### **Completed (100%)**
- **Data Processing & EDA**: Cleaned 3 datasets, removed 1,081 duplicates, comprehensive analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Created temporal features, IP-to-country mapping, fraud indicators
- **Class Imbalance**: Implemented SMOTE, balanced training data from 9.36% to 50% fraud ratio
- **Model Development**: Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models

### **Partially Completed (80%)**
- **Model Evaluation**: ROC curves, performance metrics, confusion matrices
- **Infrastructure**: Project structure, requirements, training scripts

### **Not Completed (25%)**
- **API Development**: No web service created
- **Production Deployment**: No Docker containerization
- **Advanced Features**: No hyperparameter tuning or model optimization

## Risk Assessment

**Risks:**
- Time constraints for advanced features
- Technical complexity of API development
- Resource limitations for deployment

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize core functionality
- Incremental development approach
- Allocate time for learning new technologies
